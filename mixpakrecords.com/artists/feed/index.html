				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="thread-entry__content formatted_content">Channeling the dual influences of his family’s native Colombia and his UK upbringing, Florentino’s productions combine the low frequency pressure of contemporary UK club music with the vivid sound palette of Latin America.</p>
<p>Known for his prolific output of edits, remixes and originals, his latest EPs <em>Ilimitado</em> and <em>Fragmentos </em>have seen him team up with exciting artists from across the spanish-speaking world and beyond, including MC Bin Laden, Bad Gyal, Kaydy Cain, Albany, Ms Nina &amp; more.</p>
<p>From melodic slow jams to hi octane percussive club killers, a rugged romanticism always reigns supreme. It’s mutant reggaeton with a ruffneck UK attitude &#8211; bold, unconventional and instantly recognisable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born out of his travels through the many global currents of contemporary London, GAIKA&#8217;s music is dark yet melodic, experimental yet catchy. While drawing strongly from his Brixton upbringing and his Jamaican and Grenadian heritage, GAIKA’s sound is ultimately expansive, seamlessly weaving musical motifs, vocal flows and slangs of UK, US and Caribbean music.</p>
<p>As both a vocalist and producer, GAIKA is as uncompromising in his politics as his sonics, intent on expanding and exploding the ideas of what contemporary black british music is. Channeling the unique synthesis of the UK&#8217;s musical make-up, GAIKA is firmly at the forefront of a new London.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born in St.Louis, Mr. One Hundred&#8217;s early dance music education consisted of seriously underage raving at a time when the American Midwest had arguably the best underground party scene in the world. He rolls off a few formative experiences: Richie Hawtin playing live in a warehouse completely covered in black plastic, people doing the worm to a 6am Moodyman set in an abandoned St. Louis strip mall storefront, and Robert Armani DJing an entire set wearing white gloves. He co-founded a label and made deeper connections to Detroit by travelling to the motor city for all the production &#8211; every vinyl was mastered by Ron Murphy (the same guy who mastered Kevin Saunderson, Underground Resistance, +8, Derrick May and Jeff Mills). After a tour of duty through Chicago&#8217;s art &amp; performance scenes, Mr. One Hundred ended up in London, UK, and was deeply influened by London&#8217;s cultural and musical milieu.</p>
<p>Then two things then happened. As Mr. One Hundred explains it, &#8220;First I started DJing at the (now legendary) 7 Year Glitch and Teens of Thailand parties where I met Silverlink &#8211; he was the first DJ I saw mix soca into Jeff Mills and it blew my mind. Second is I lived next to a Trinidadian-run BBQ chicken shop whose owner Lyndon was an ex-Soca DJ, and he started feeding me mixtapes of his old crew Spoil Bratz. Plus I was going out in London, hearing soca mixed up with other kinds of music, going to carnival, all of that. I decided to experiment with soca rhythms, fusing them with detroit techno sounds to make a new type of music. I tried my first beat, H.O.W. Riddim, and when I played it for Lyndon he just said &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s it&#8221; and I went from there. Now with the Top Nice crew we&#8217;ve created an audience for this new soca sound at our parties, H.O.W. Riddim is on the Mixpak release, and I have a name for what I make: Power Soca music from the future!!!&#8221;</p>

<div>His debut album for Mixpak, <em>Pagan</em>, was hailed as “an emotional blend of recognizable and alien pop music” by The New Yorker and “an earnest reflection on London’s lost youth” by Crack Magazine.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born and raised in Lyon, France, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mixpak/sets/inna-style-n-fashion-riddims" target="_blank">Douster</a> started his musical life somewhere between the popular sound of eurodance and the 50s rhythm n blues tapes that were blasted from his family car. At the age of just 8, he turned to French rap and hip hop music would stay with him during his teenage years.</p>
<p>After buying his first MKII&#8217;s at the age 14 to start scratching, he very quickly moved into production and started making beats for his friends. Under the influence of dancehall music and high powered dub soundsystems, he started to add heavy sub bass to his productions. And when a close friend brought him a crate full of smiley faced vinyl, he fell in love with acid house and early 90s New Beat.</p>
<p>With releases on top labels such as Mad Decent or Sound Pellegrino and widely acclaimed remixes for the likes of Crookers, Rusko, Yolanda Be Cool and Kid Sister, his sound has quickly gained international notoriety.</p>
